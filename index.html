<h2>What is Korean Bedroom Decor?</h2>
<p>Korean bedroom decor is rooted in the philosophy of "less is more." It emphasizes clean lines, neutral color palettes, and natural materials to create a calming and clutter-free space. This design style draws inspiration from traditional Korean homes, known as hanok, which prioritize harmony with nature and simplicity. Modern Korean decor incorporates these timeless elements while adding contemporary touches to suit today’s lifestyles.</p>
<h2>Key Elements of Korean Bedroom Decor</h2>
<h2>Neutral Color Palette</h2>
<p>Korean bedroom decor often features soft, muted tones such as beige, white, gray, and pastel shades. These colors evoke a sense of tranquility and make the space feel larger and more open.</p>
<h2>Natural Materials</h2>
<p>Incorporate materials like wood, bamboo, and linen to bring a touch of nature indoors. Wooden furniture, woven rugs, and linen bedding are staples of this style, adding warmth and texture to the room.</p>
